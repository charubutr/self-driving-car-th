# Thailand self-driving car initiative <h1>

  Today we would like to make an announcement of the self-driving car initiative in Thailand.

  Self-driving car is going to become a major transformative technology of the future. Many research labs and automotive companies are launching their self-driving car intiatives all over the world. However the technology it self is not immediately transferable to all nations and locations. Unlike a car that can drive on all roads regardless of where it is made, self-driving car is more like a driver who would need a driving license for the country that it is driving in. Due to different landscapes, traffic signs and expectations of pedastrians and other objects on the road, a self-driving car trained in San Francisco might have a good chance of successful driving in New York but would be facing a different kind of challenges in Bangkok, Hanoi or Mumbai.

  The technology itself is relatively new, relying on multiple sensor fusions from camera, lidars, radars and having intelligent algorithm that makes a decision that runs on data from those sensors. To make self-driving car work, data would need to be collected from those sensors. Radars and lidars data are pretty hard for an average person to collect those data however, camera data is plentiful, with hugely popular dashcam
  
  How can you contribute to make the road safer in Thailand and help us make the future that is based on talent grown here not UBER or other companies ?
  
  Its very simple, you can help us kick start by contributing your dashcam video data. Your dashcam footage will be the forming the first opensource Thailand self-driving dataset where we invite innovators, dreamers and futurists to test and make their self-driving car algorithm on the dataset
